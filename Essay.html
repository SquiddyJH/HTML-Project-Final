        This project was a fun and interesting project as it tested what I already knew about web development and expanded my overall knowledge on the topic, during this project I was able to make something I was somewhat proud of as I'd never experimented with CSS before and being able to make something that's simple yet sleek in design was very enjoyable for me. Learning to create lists, buttons and more was one of the better parts of the web development section as it was very different to the rest of the coding aspect. Although I struggled at first I quickly caught on to the concept behind them and how they worked.
        The design element of the project was much more difficult for me overall as I have little to no experience in the area, learning about all the typographic systems was a challenge due to the fact that they all have a very unique style and design, using these styles to create a design using illustrator was what took me the longest as I had to learn a new design program alongside learning how to create a web page to showcase my designs.
        Adobe InDesign was the next hurdle in this project as it was a third program I had to learn and understand, however I quickly picked up InDesign and was able to make the three posters quite effectively and to a standard I was happy with, although I had issues using the program at first I was able to accustom myself to it so that I could easily create and design following the CARP rules.
        Visual Studio Code made the HTML and CSS aspect of the project much easier to follow as I could utilise the instant complete in VSC to make large segments of code faster as well as make sure that they function. This was incredibly useful as when coding previously I would forget certain things in the code such as a colon or bracket which would cause the whole program to break and I would spend ages scrolling to try and find the issue, however this was not an issue with Visual Studio
        My overall consensus on the project was that it was enjoyable to complete all the while being very stressful at times as I had to meet deadlines for individual parts of the project to ensure that I could have everything in place and organised in a way that was presentable, easy to read and was accessible to as many people as possible. This was the biggest challenge of them all as trying to make a website as a first time developer and having to achieve these three criteria that I set myself gave me more of a reason to create the website the way I did as it doesn't have too much happening at once, follows a simple design and has very simple and easy to use features that will quickly redirect you to a different page that has my second set of images and my paragraph about the page.

        <p>This page showcases the typographic systems I learnt about and applies them to create designs based on set text. This was done to show I understand the different typographic systems and that I can utilise them. Using each system differently was a challenge but once I understood the concept behind each system it made it much easier to generate a design in my head. Although the designs aren't perfect and aren't to a brilliant standard in terms of hwo they look they follow the key points of what makes the design </p>
        <p>1. This is Bilateral, it's a very simple design and is used in many designs as it's easy to follow and read</p>
        <p>2. This is Modular, it utilises a similar design pattern to organise items into a simple design</p>
        <p>3. This is Random, as seen in the image itself everything is all over the place and hard to follow, this is only used for very specific designs</p>
        <p>4.. This is Radial, Radial uses a base which is usually a circle that has text going around it's outer edges, although it can be hard to follow it's simple and effective</p>
        <p>5. This is Axial. Axial uses sharp edges to make up it's design, it often has the text following the egdes so that the consumer will read from top to bottom</p>
        <p>6. This is Dilatational, this system uses curved text, which is sometimes around a set point to make a design for more abstract designs and works effectively in this scenario</p>
        <p>7. This is Grid, Grid follows a very simple idea and is very uniform in it's design as it follows a set area for text and images to make a sleek look overall</p>
        <p>8. This is Transitional, this uses the idea that text should be natural, although my design doesn't follow this to the letter it's as close as I could make it, this system isn't used often due to it's complexity and abstract concept</p>

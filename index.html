    <p>1. This poster was my first design, I decided to use as little 'white space' as possible so that the poster didn't feel empty however it lead to some of the images looking very stretched and out of place. I put all the sponsors on the side to make them feel separate to the main focus as they aren't the main part of the poster. I kept the text with the main focus as it's important information related to the event.</p>
    <p>2. This poster was made as a follow up to the first poster to fix the issues with the original. I centralised the main logo for the event to keep it as the main focus of the poster with the balloon images as well/ The text was grouped together so that it's easy to see and read. The sponsors were all grouped at the top to make them easily visible and so that people looking at the poster can look at the poster in 3 stages.</p>
    <p>3. This poster follows a more abstract design with all elements spread around to maximize the space. I kept the same idea of centralising the balloons and logo so that they're easily visible to keep the theme of the event constant. The text was moved just on top of these images so that it looks in line with the main images and allows for easy viewing. The sponsors are spread around to keep the poster more spread out and not feel conjested. I utilised white space on this poster so that the elements felt like they had more space and looked more free compared to the other designs.</p>

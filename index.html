    <p>1. This poster was my first design, I decided to use as little 'white space' as possible so that the poster didn't feel empty however it lead to some of the images looking very stretched and out of place. I put all the sponsors on the side to make them feel separate to the main focus as they aren't the main part of the poster. I kept the text with the main focus as it's important information related to the event.</p>
